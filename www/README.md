# sigtools-shiny

Sigtools is an R-based visualization package, designed to enable the
users with limited programming experience to produce statistical plots
of continuous genomic data. It consists of several statistical
visualizations that provide insights regarding the behavior of a group
of signals in large regions – such as a chromosome or the whole genome –
as well as visualizing them around a specific point or short region.
